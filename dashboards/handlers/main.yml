## Restart dashboards nodes.  If this is not the initial install, do each in-turn, ensuring each node is *really* back up (i.e. port 5601 is open) before restarting the next.
## This is an ugly way to do it, but it seems there is no alternative: 'throttle' applied to a block will apply throttle to each element of the block, so it will restart the service one-by-one, then wait for port 9200 one-by-one, which means the entire cluster will be down.  Also, 'throttle' cannot be applied to include/import_tasks.
